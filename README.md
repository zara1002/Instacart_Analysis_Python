# Objective

In this project I work as an analyst at Instacart, an online grocery store operating through a mobile app. Instacart is already doing well in terms of sales, but the company is eager to gain a deeper understanding of its sales patterns. My current task involves conducting an initial data analysis and exploration of some of their data to extract valuable insights and recommend strategies for improved segmentation.

The primary focus of this analysis is on understanding the diverse customer base and their purchasing behaviors. Instacart acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach won't suffice and is contemplating a more targeted marketing strategy. The aim is to tailor marketing campaigns to different customer segments and evaluate their impact on product sales. My analysis will play a crucial role in shaping this strategy, ensuring that Instacart effectively targets the right customer profiles with the most relevant products.
